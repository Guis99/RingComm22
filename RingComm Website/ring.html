        <div class = 'ring-part'>THE BEZEL</div>
        <div class = 'bezel'><p>The beaver stands at the center of the Massachusetts Avenue bridge, halfway between Cambridge and Boston
          and overlooking the river. While it faces Boston and the future awaiting it and us, whom it represents, the
          beaver also looks back towards Cambridge, reminiscing over its time at MIT. In its hands, the beaver holds a
          diploma scroll that transforms into a key, as your time at MIT will open countless doors and opportunities.
          In that same spirit, the beaver wears a brass rat, as a symbol of connection to the class of 2022 and the Institute
          which harbors it, and the 155 Smoot represents our class being the 155th graduating class from the Institute.
          An ivy leaf is blown across the lower right corner, acknowledging our cross-registration opportunities at Harvard.
          Finally, getting an education from MIT is notoriously akin to taking a drink from a firehose, so a firehose can be
          found draped across the railing of the bridge.</p>

        <p>The Cambridge bank of the Charles River is dominated by the Great Dome and other significant campus buildings.
          This year, we chose to open up the landscape to accommodate beautiful Killian court, on the one hand to celebrate
          this integral feature of the MIT campus, and on the other to remind us of the importance of the time we take to relax
           in between assignments. To the left of Killian, below the Student Center, is Kresge, the place we were united as a
           class for the very first time during orientation. To the right is Walker Memorial, with MIT’s unofficial motto “IHTFP”
           hidden in its columns as a reminder of the examinations taken there. The Green Building windows proudly spell out a “22”,
           while a pumpkin hurtles down its side accelerating at 9.81 m/s^2 in the downward direction, in honor of the great annual
           East Campus Pumpkin Drop.</p>

        <p>In the foreground of the Boston bank glows the Citgo sign, arguably the brightest feature of the Boston skyline.
          Visible from dorms, main campus, and the bridge alike, it is an ever-present companion to our work. Below the sign
          is a lamppost in honor of the nights in which the Boston Commons were swarmed by fans, and lamps broken, in the aftermath of major
          victories by Boston sports teams. Behind it is a series of brownstone houses, featured to represent the FSILG communities and students
          residing on the other side of the bridge. The Prudential Center is another prominent feature in the skyline. It is a symbol of Boston’s
          economic renewal in the 60’s and 70’s, and stands alongside a crane, to represent the ongoing construction and development of the city.
          The New England Aquarium, where we held the first of our class outings, and one of the places we will take leave from one another in our senior year,
          can be found further back, near the Longfellow Bridge. Behind even that, the Red Line of the T streaks across the bridge.</p>

        <p>Over the decades that students have been punting and tooling their way through MIT, the Charles River has run along its course much as
          it has for thousands of years. This year, we emphasize the constant flow of the water with a smooth, swirling texture. Two eddies curl
          into a 6 and 9, to celebrate the creation of the new 6-9 major. The class of 2022 was also the first test for MIT’s new PNR policy for GIRs,
          which has helped keep many of us afloat these past years. Consequently, the planks of the river dock river spell out the letters PNR.
          On the other side of the river, the MIT Engineers beaver debuts on the Brass Rat, swimming down the MIT Crew Racecourse as bystanders cheer
          it on from the shore, in recognition of MIT’s athletes and athletic program. Finally, a Tech Dingy skippered by a pirate leans into the wind,
          a nod to the pirates license built into our PE program. Amidst the stars the moon wanes, its phase that of our graduation day. The stars themselves,
          peppered across the night sky, forming part of a caffeine molecule which is completed by landmarks on the ring. Our skyline features a shooting star
          in memory of those classmates who will not be with us when we walk on graduation day.</p></div>

        <div class = 'ring-part'>SEAL SHANK</div>
        <p>The seal shank, added to the Brass Rat in 1980, represents the school and its values. Its design represents MIT’s founders’ desire to form an institution
          which lies at the intersections between the applied and the theoretical as well as the sciences and the humanities. Over the years, each class redefines
          how those values are interpreted, so every year the seal subtly changes. This year, the seal’s design emphasizes diversity, an essential feature of our
          experience at MIT. We replace the traditional white men with a man and woman of color of our age. The woman, a smith, symbolizes MIT’s dedication to craft and
          innovation. She sports a contemporary wardrobe, similar to many students around campus, to show that each of us has the potential to do amazing things.
          This year, she a second pedestal puts her on an equal footing to her male counterpart. </p>

          <p>The man on the right dons a classic laboratory coat in favor of his traditional robes, and is reading a textbook. The practical attire reflects MIT’s
          multifaceted approach to learning, which incorporates both theory and practice, otherwise known as mens et manus. Between them, the flame of the lamp reads “22”,
          in honor of our class year.</p>

          <p>Our seal is borne up by an owl, a counterpart to Athena on the opposite shank. It too represents fair judgment, loyalty, and integrity, values which we
          believe are essential to the success of the Institute. Its geometric wings resemble turbine blades. This biomimicry suggests the inspirations we take
          from nature to advance our technology, as well as our application of technology to give back to nature. The owl’s talons grasp both an olive and an oak
          branch. The olive branch is meant to symbolize peace, while the oak branch symbolizes strength.</p>

          <div class = 'ring-part'>CLASS SHANK</div>
          <p>The class shank has been an integral part of the Brass Rat since its conception.
            The Great Dome used to be featured on both sides of the ring, but has been featured
            exclusively on the class shank since the introduction of the seal shank in the 1980s.
            It is fully dedicated to the indomitable spirit of our class and the student body. </p>

          <p>Prominently displayed on the front of our shank is the mythological three-headed dog Cerberus
           who guards the Gates of Hades (otherwise known as Lobby 10). Not only is Cerberus Kerberos’
           namesake, but the dog is also an emblem of MIT students’ collaborative nature and grit.
           Just as the heads of Cerberus work in tandem, so do we work together to accomplish our goals,
           building a culture and spirit unique to MIT. Moreover, although they are a team, the heads remain
           individuals, each symbolizing different things. The precise meaning of each dog head will differ
           depending on who you ask: mind, hand, heart; reduce, reuse, recycle. In mythology, they were
           believed to look into past, present, and future, thereby representing our past accomplishments,
           present determination, and future aspirations. Cerberus serves as a reminder of all the times we
           have succeeded against the odds, and that our daily struggle is every bit worth the effort and time
           we put into it.</p>

          <p>Standing guard behind Cerberus is Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war. She shares a name with
            our academic computing environment, and represents MIT students’ intellectual curiosity, and
            devotion to being lifelong learners. Draped around Athena’s neck is a torque, a manifestation of
            our free will and autonomy, both in school and after graduation. Her armor blends into a bionic arm,
            representing the visible and invisible disabilities in our community, and our dedicated support for
            those who need it. Her hand is placed on Cerberus’ back in a gesture of friendship, but also as a reminder
            that we who are privileged with the opportunity to learn are also accountable for the ethical and moral
            decisions we make with that knowledge.</p>

        <p>The Boston skyline has been a feature of the MIT experience since the Institute moved to Cambridge in 1916,
          and fittingly also of the Brass Rat. While major landmarks persist from year to year, new additions such as
          the One Dalton Hotel remind us of the dynamic tapestry of the city around us. The nighttime view is emblematic
          of the many late hours we spend working on our assignments, socializing, and exploring the city, while a plane
          banking over Faneuil Hall represents MIT’s many ties to the global community. These include our international peers;
          the incredible MISTI program and travel opportunities MIT provides; the worldwide impact of our work and ventures.
          Spotlight beams sweep over Fenway to complete the skyline, illuminating the lives of MIT students in Back Bay and Fenway. </p>

        <div class = 'ring-part'>CAMBRIDGE SKYLINE</div>
        <p>Cambridge has been MIT’s home for over a century, and ours for the past two years. This side of the ring is daylit,
          to symbolize when we have classes and lectures are held. While there are many noteworthy buildings to choose from, we
          highlight those with particular significance to our class. The Stud, for instance, was where many of us were first welcomed
          to MIT during CPW. On the ring, the Infinite Corridor is gilded as a tribute to MITHenge, when the sun’s beam light up its full length.
          Above campus, a black hole is visible in the sky to celebrate the first-ever image of black hole, which a research group led by an MIT alumnus
          captured during our freshman year. Below it, an 8+ rowing shell cuts across the Charles, a common sight on the river, and a symbol of MIT’s powerful
          athletics presence. </p>

        <div class = 'ring-part'>THE HACKER'S MAP</div>
        The Hacker’s Map on the inverse of the bezel traces out the network of tunnels under the MIT campus. These are home not only to many of our labs and workspaces,
        but also to MIT’s intrepid hacking culture. The legacy of classic hacks such as the infamous police-car-on-the-dome and ‘82-balloon-hack is upheld to this day,
        as an enormous replica of Captain America’s shield graced the Great Dome in April 2019. Curiously, the Hacker’s Map itself only recently became an icon for this aspect
        of student life. It would take almost 20 years for the initial design, premiering under the name of “Corona” in the 1990’s, to become known as the “Hacker’s Map”.
        This year, we include the recently added Nano Extension, to celebrate a lab pioneering all things exquisitely small and marking a great step for progress in the field.
        The π symbol below the dome has much significance to MIT students in general, it being an iconic irrational number as well as being the anniversary of our admissions results.
        For our year, it is an added reminder of our official Class Reunion date, which will be held in Las Vegas precisely 3.14 years after our graduation.
